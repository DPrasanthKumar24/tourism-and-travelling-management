 TOUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM :
Previously people wishing to visit places had to manually search for available accommodation at the visiting places. Also they themselves had to make reservation. 
People hardly had any knowledge of which are the worth seeing places and about its history. Such procedure was time consuming and energy wasting.
Tour Reservation System has made life very easy for such visitors by saving both their time and energy.
Visitor requests for scheme to check the availability of the desired tour package. This information is stored in Tour Information System.
System will check whether the customer is existing or new. New user will enter his personal and tour details for reservation. 
In turn he/she will be provided with system generated unique ID and password. This login information could be used for further transactions.
When customer is satisfied with tour package he/she would request for reservation of tour. Personal details of new customer is stored in cust_info

in Tour Information System.

 reflected in Tour Information System.
